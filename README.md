## 18F Blogging Guide

This guide helps 18F employees through the blogging process and assists them in properly framing their post so that it’s concise, readable, and achieves its goals. You can read the 18F blog at [18f.gsa.gov/blog/](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/).

### For 18F team members
If you have any questions, ask them in #blog or by email to 18f-outreach@gsa.gov.  

Everyone at 18F is encouraged to contribute to our blog. We value a diversity of voices and positions. You don’t have to be a project lead, be in management, or even be at 18F for a set amount of time to draft a post. If you’ve got an idea that you think will help advance 18F’s mission, we’d love to hear it.

### For the public
Many of the links in this guide will not work for members of the public since they are to internal documents or private repos. We're making this guide public because 18F defaults to transparency, and we believe this guide may help other agencies and organizations set up an efficient and effective blogging process. As with all projects at 18F, this guide is an iterative and living document. We're constantly looking to improve our process and our documentation and may make updates to this guide as things change. If you have questions about our process or this document you can [file an issue](https://github.com/18F/blogging-guide/issues), email us at [18f-outreach@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-outreach@gsa.gov), or [send us a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/18f).
