This guide helps 18F employees through the blogging process and assists
them in properly framing their post so that it’s concise, readable, and
achieves its goals. If you have any questions, ask them in \#blog or by
email to [18f-outreach@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-outreach@gsa.gov).

Everyone at 18F is encouraged to contribute to [our blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/). We value a
diversity of voices and positions. You don’t have to be a project lead,
be in management, or even be at 18F for a set amount of time to draft a
post. If you’ve got an idea that you think will help advance [18F’s mission](https://github.com/18F/core-values/blob/mission-vision/pages/vision-mission.md),
we’d love to hear it.

*Note: If you are not in GSA or on the 18F
team, many of the links in this guide will likely _not_ work for you.*
