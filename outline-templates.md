title: Outline templates
---

You’ll likely have half a dozen ideas for blog posts for every project
you work on. Creating an outline is a great way to move from a jumble of
ideas into something you can get down into text.

Below are a number of outlines for the types of blog posts we typically
write at 18F. Give it a read, and see if any of them match up with what
you’d like to communicate. The goal of these templates is to help you
refine your idea, not to fit your writing into a rigid format. Feel free
to modify the structure and change the section headings to be specific
to your writing. As you’ll see, many of the linked examples only loosely
follow these formats.

Make sure to also [consider your
audience](https://blogging-guide.18f.gov/content-guidelines/) as you
begin drafting.
