title: Authorship
---

The authors listed on a blog post should be only the people who have
actively contributed significant portions of text to the blog post.
Generally, posts should only be written by one or two people. Limiting
the number of people who write a post makes it feel more personal and
less written by committee, allows for a stronger voice in the writing,
and helps speed up the editing and approval process.

Multiple authors
----------------

Some posts may have significant amounts of text written by more than two people, in which case every contributor should be listed as an author.

Team members who contributed editing, criticism, quotes, images, or
small amounts of text should not be included as authors. You should also
not include people as authors if they worked on a project but did not
write the post. If there are people who contributed to a project or who
helped make a blog post a reality (for example, by helping with idea
generation, design, or editing), you can thank them with an italicized
section at the bottom of the post.

If a post has multiple authors, then it should only use plural pronouns
(we, our). Team members who are listed as authors should not be referred
to by name or quoted in the text of the post since the post is already
being attributed to them.

Things to consider when choosing authors:

-   Authors of a post are likely to get emails about that subject. If you're listed as an author on a post, you should be able to answer (or know who can) most questions that would be emailed to you.
-   Posts you have authored will automatically be listed on your 18F biography.
-   Other people (for example, the press) may attribute anything in the post to you, and may reach out for additional interviews.

Guest authors
-------------

The 18F blog welcomes guest authors from other government agencies. They're especially good for highlighting the innovative work happening
around the government, getting a different perspective on 18F projects,
and for showing how agencies are adapting our tools for their own use.
Our blog team is happy to work with guest authors to develop
an idea and edit their writing. We'll work to support their tone and
voice, but all posts on the 18F blog will follow our [Content
Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/). Posts from guest authors
will have to go through the communications approval process at their
agency as well as at 18F and GSA.

No authors
----------

On occasion, it can be useful to have posts written by 18F as an
organization rather than as an individual. We may use this for posts
that explain fundamental concepts of our business or culture where many
team members contributed writing and editing. Posts with 18F as an
author have a more formal and authoritative tone and are about
statements of policy or fact rather than opinions.
