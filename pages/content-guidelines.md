title: Writing a great post
---

Keep it user centered
---------------------

Blog posts should offer something to the reader, whether that’s a new
tool for them to use, a guide they can use to improve their own work, or
educational information about a complicated topic or process. You should begin with the thing your readers should take away from your post, and why it matters to them.

Sometimes the process of building something or tackling a particularly
thorny challenge is what makes a post worth writing, but those posts
should still be framed around offering techniques to your readers.
Spending too much time saying a problem was difficult and that we solved
it isn’t helpful to the reader unless we also offer a solution so they
can avoid this problem in their own work.

If it feels like a marathon, make it a series
---------------------------------------------

Our mission is broad, but our strategy is small steps. This applies to
how we build products, how we ship culture, how we educate, and how we
blog. No single post is going to cover the breadth of a topic or
completely convince an agency to adopt our practices. **The goal of a
blog post should be to communicate one idea clearly, and make it short
and readable enough for your audience to read the whole thing**. It’s
likely that as you're writing a post, all kinds of details and new
ideas will pop into your head. That’s great! Write them down and save
them for future posts where you can give them the full space they
deserve.

Consider breaking up your post into a series that will bring the reader
along to learn a new skill or gain a deep understanding of how a product
was built. Breaking up a long post allows readers to complete and digest
each section without getting overwhelmed.

Write a user story to determine your audience
---------------------------------------------

It’s crucial to decide on your target audience before you start drafting
a blog post. Being as specific as you can will help you answer a number
of questions about what your post will look like. “General public” or
“the federal government” is too broad of an audience to be useful.

Clearly defining your audience will help you determine length, technical
detail, tone, how much background you need to include, and what ask you
will include at the end. You can help define the audience and goal of
your post by creating a [user
story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).

For this type of user story, you can use this simple format:

>As a *type of audience*, I want *to learn something*, so that
*some benefit is had*.

In this story, you would fill in the italicized sections with an audience
type, a goal, and a benefit. **Make your audience type as specific as
possible.**

If you’re writing about a new service that 18F is offering, your user
story might be:

>“As a *Chief Information Officer*, I want *to learn about the specifics
of 18F’s new service*, so that *I can see if it will help me modernize
my agency’s technology*.”

This narrow focus will help you decide a number of things. Because your
audience is federal technologists, you can assume a certain familiarity
with government processes and terms. This allows you to go a little
deeper into government procedure and some of the nitty-gritty of how
this product works. You might also choose to use a slightly more formal
tone for this post since this could be the opening message in a
businesses conversation.

If you’re writing about a new little tool you built while working on a
larger project, your user story might be:

>“As a *member of the open source community*, I want *to
know what this tool does*, so that *I can contribute
back to the code*.”

Using this framework for your post, you can be more technical, more
enthusiastic about your small solution, and use a more informal tone
appropriate for the open source community. You would also be sure to
include links for readers who want to dive into the code and get
involved.

If you’re not sure how to define your ideal audience, check out this list
of common audiences for 18F posts:

-   Federal chief information officers
-   The open source or civic tech community
-   Potential client agencies
-   Federal technology journalists
-   Specific user groups (federal contracting officers, frequent FOIA filers, fourth graders)
-   Potential recruits to join 18F
-   Federal profession areas (content designer, 508 officer, front end designer, security engineer)
